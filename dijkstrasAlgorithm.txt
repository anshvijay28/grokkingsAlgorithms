(current node = start node)
Let the distance from the start node be 0 (in the known distances table)
Let known distances to all other nodes be infinity 

Calculate distance of neighbors to start node 
if calculated distance is less than known distance:
    update distance value in the table:
        distance would be distance from current node to this neighbor plus distance from current node to starting node
    say previous node of this node is the current node 

add current node to list of visited nodes and take it out of list of unvisited nodes
update current node to be the node with the shortest known distance from current node 

repeat this process until all nodes are visited
